# Martingale System by Profectus AI

This code represents a Martingale trading bot developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. The purpose of this bot is to generate trading signals and execute trades based on a specific strategy known as the Martingale system. The Martingale system is a popular betting strategy that originated in 18th century France and has since been adapted for various trading markets, including the foreign exchange market (Forex).

The MartingaleBot class implemented in this code contains several member variables and functions that are crucial for the functioning of the bot:

## Member Variables

- `accountBalance`: Represents the current balance of the trading account.
- `riskLimit`: Specifies the maximum risk that the bot is willing to take for each trade, as a percentage of the account balance.
- `stopLoss`: Defines the price level at which a losing trade should be closed to limit potential losses.
- `takeProfit`: Determines the price level at which a winning trade should be closed to secure profits.
- `entryPrice`: Stores the price at which a trade is entered.
- `tradeSize`: Represents the size of each trade, calculated based on the account balance and risk limit.
- `trades`: A vector that stores the entry prices of executed trades.

## Constructor

The constructor of the MartingaleBot class is responsible for initializing the member variables `accountBalance`, `riskLimit`, `stopLoss`, and `takeProfit`. Additionally, it sets the `entryPrice` to 0 and calculates the initial `tradeSize` using the `calculateTradeSize` function.

## Member Functions

1. `calculateTradeSize`: This function calculates the size of each trade based on the account balance and risk limit. The specific logic for determining the trade size should be implemented by the user.
2. `generateSignal`: This function generates trading signals based on certain conditions. The logic for generating signals should be implemented by the user. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether a signal is generated.
3. `executeTrade`: This function executes trades based on the generated signals. The specific logic for executing trades should be implemented by the user. In this code, the executed trades are stored in the `trades` vector.
4. `calculateResults`: This function calculates and displays the trading results based on the executed trades. The specific logic for calculating the results should be implemented by the user.

## Main Function

The main function of the code creates an instance of the MartingaleBot class with initial values for the account balance, risk limit, stop loss, and take profit. It then calls the `trade` function to generate trading signals and execute trades, followed by the `calculateResults` function to calculate and display the trading results.
